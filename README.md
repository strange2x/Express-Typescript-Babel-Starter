# Express-Typescript-Babel-Starter
A starter template for Express application with **Node, Typescript, Babel, Eslint, Prettier, Jest** *Pre-Configured*.

- I'm using **yarn**, **npm** can also be used.
- For changing the configuration for **ESLint** or **Prettier**, please go to *package.json* file
- You can also check the **different commands** that are being used in *package.json* file

***Test are just added to confirm that Jest is working fine using Babel and babel-typescript plugin***
